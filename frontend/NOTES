Modify the variable IVL_DIR in rule.mk (or Makefile) to change the frontend.

The version 0.9.7 is at iverilog-0.9.7. It is managed by our git system.
It is a stable version, but it has a serious bug. The bug is on constant
evaluation with unsigned operations. This causes the failure of the test case:
language/expression/signed/test3

The current head version of icarus verilog is at iverilog. It is NOT managed
by our git system. The source code can be checked out using clone.sh.

A snapshot of 0.10.0 is created from the working version. It is managed by our
git system. It's directory is iverilog-working, and it is the currently used
version.

# 2
The versions 0.9.x and 0.10.x has some incompatibilities:

The following files in both versions are modified:
  Makefile.in : add ../tgt-cmodelgen to SUBDIRS
  configure.in : add ../tgt-cmodelgen/Makefile to AC_OUTPUT

To use 0.10.x versions, the macro 'CMODELGEN_USES_0_10' must be defined in
frontend.h.

# 3
Switching versions also require modifications in regression test.

These test cases can be enabled if 0.10.x is used, but must be disabled
otherwise:
  error/language/datatype/drive/test3
  error/language/expression/test4

Moreover, error/language/unknown/test1 must be modified, as the error message
would be different:
0.9.7                            vs 0.10.0
UnsupportedUnknownValueGenerated -> UnsupportedUnknownValueGeneratedAt.

# 4
On 2015_06_03, we have upgraded to a the latest 0.10.0.
It has better consistency with MDS and VCS. Thus test cases:

language/datatype/parameter/test8
language/datatype/parameter/test9

have their reference results modified.

Also this version no longer supports 0'd0, thus test case:

language/threestate/test1

has to be modified.

Since these cases are already modified, we no longer support downgrading
to early versions of iverilog.
