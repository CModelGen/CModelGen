================================ INTRODUCTION ==================================

In this repository, an Icarus Verilog target named cmodelgen is implemented.
It is used as the frontend program of CModelGen.

The code in this repository is under GPL version 2 and LGPL version 2. The terms
of these license files can be found in COPYING and COPYING.lesser.

In this repository, the code of Icarus Verilog is redistributed.

=================================== BUILD ======================================

The frontend program can be built on Linux and Windows. On Windows, please use
Msys2 to build it.

To build the frontend program, please execute the following command under the
root directory of this repository.

> make

The command will configure Icarus Verilog and the CModelGen target, make them,
then install them to the build/frontend directory.

Note that some programs are required to build this application. These programs
include but may not limit to:

make
gcc
g++
bison
flex

===================================== USE ======================================

The frontend program parses Verilog code into an Intermediate Representation
(IR) and dumps the IR to an output file. The IR is dumped either in text format
or binary format. When it is dumped in binary format, it can be used as an input
of the Optimizing Code Generator (OCG) program of CModelGen to generate C/C++
simulation models.

To use the built frontend program, please download (and install) CModelGen from
www.cmodelgen.org and replace the following files with built files.

bin/iverilog-cmodelgen
lib/ivl-cmodelgen/ivl
lib/ivl-cmodelgen/ivlpp
lib/ivl-cmodelgen/cmodelgen.tgt
lib/ivl-cmodelgen/cmodelgen.conf
