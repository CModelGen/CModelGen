[BuddyWorks][buddyworks-homepage] is a [Docker][docker-homepage]-based CI server that you can set up in 15-20 minutes to build, test, and deploy your Jekyll websites. It supports [GitHub][github-homepage], [Bitbucket][bitbucket-homepage], and [GitLab][gitlab-homepage] repositories, and can be installed on-premises or used in cloud. The following guide will show you how to set up a free environment to build and test your Jekyll project.

[docker-homepage]: https://www.docker.com/
[github-homepage]: https://github.com
[bitbucket-homepage]: https://bitbucket.org/
[gitlab-homepage]: https://gitlab.com

## 1. Getting started

1. Log in at https://buddy.works with your GitHub/Bitbucket account or email
2. Choose your Git provider and select or push your Jekyll Project
3. Create a new pipeline and set the trigger mode to 'On every push'
4. Add and configure the Jekyll action and save the pipeline

## 2. How it works

Whenever you make a push to the selected branch, the Jekyll action runs `jekyll build` in an isolated [Jekyll Docker image][jekyll-docker-image]. The output is generated to the `/filesystem` directory, and can be further deployed to FTP/SFTP and IaaS services. You can add your own commands, install additional packages, attach services, and run Selenium tests, as well as add other actions down the pipeline, eg. a Slack notification or an SSH script that will restart your server.

## 3. Using YAML for configuration

If you prefer configuration as code over GUI, you can generate a `buddy.yml` that will create a pipeline with the Jekyll action once you push it to the target branch:

```ruby
- pipeline: "Build and Deploy Jekyll site"
  trigger_mode: "ON_EVERY_PUSH"
  ref_name: "master"
  actions:
  - action: "Execute: jekyll build"
    type: "BUILD"
    docker_image_name: "jekyll/jekyll"
    docker_image_tag: "latest"
    execute_commands:
    - "chown jekyll:jekyll $WORKING_DIR"
    - "jekyll build"
```

## 4. Setting up on-premises server

The self-hosted version of BuddyWorks can be installed on any type of server supporting Docker, including [Linux][bw-linux], [Mac][bw-mac], [AWS EC2][bw-aws-ec2], [DigitalOcean][bw-digitalocean], and [Microsoft Azure][bw-azure].
