[GitHub Pages upgraded to Jekyll 3.0.2][1] last week. With a testbed of
over a million sites, this really put Jekyll 3 through the wringer. This
release addresses a handful of bugs that were surfaced as a result. The
fixes:

* Fix problem where outputting to a folder would have two extensions
* Handle tildes (`~`) in filenames properly
* Fix issue when comparing documents without dates
* Include line numbers in liquid error output

Read more on the [changelog](/docs/history/#v3-0-3) with links to the
related patches.

Please keep [submitting bugs][2] as you find them! Please do take a look

forum][3] for asking questions and getting help on a specific problem
you're having.

Happy Jekylling!
