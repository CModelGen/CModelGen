There's always at least one bug, right? :)

Hot on the trails of [v3.1.4](/news/2016/05/18/jekyll-3-1-4-released/), we
bring you v3.1.5! It fixes one bug around requiring the `ExcerptDrop`,
which only affects Linux. For the gory details, see [the pull
request for the fix](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/pull/4912).

Happy Jekylling!
