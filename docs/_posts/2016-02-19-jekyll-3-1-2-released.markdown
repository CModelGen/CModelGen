Happy Friday from sunny California! Today, we're excited to announce the release of Jekyll v3.1.2, which comes with some crucial bug fixes:

* If a syntax error is encountered by Liquid, it will now print the line number.
* A nasty war between symbols and strings in our configuration hash caused kramdown syntax highlighting to break. That has been resolved; you stand victorious!
* A tilde at the beginning of a filename will no longer crash Jekyll.
* The `titleize` filter mistakenly dropped words that were already capitalized. Fixed!
* Permalinks which end in a slash will now always output as a folder with an `index.html` inside.

Nitty-gritty details, like always, are available in the [history](/docs/history/).
