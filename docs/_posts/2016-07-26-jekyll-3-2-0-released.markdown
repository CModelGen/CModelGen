Happy Day! Jekyll v3.2.0 is out, and packed full of goodies.

Our flagship feature for this release has been **themes**. _Themes?!_, you
say? Yes, proper, versionable, releasable, first-class themes. We're pretty
stoked about it and we hope you like building and using them. For now, it
only supports layouts, includes, and sass, but we have plans to include
static assets like images and CSS/JS in a future release. [Read more about
it in the docs.](/docs/themes/) Our site template generated by `jekyll new`
now dogfoods this feature, using the [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme.

Some other notable changes:

- Symlinks are allowed as long as they target a file in the site source
- Explicit support for Ruby 2.0.x was dropped
- Added an `:after_init` Hook
- Added a `where_exp` filter to provide more powerful filtering
- Added a `link` liquid tag which can be used to generate URLs for any
post or document based on its path relative to the site source
- ... and lots more!

As always, there is [a full list of changes](/docs/history/#v3-2-0) for
your perusal.

Every release is made possible by the countless hours of hard work that our
fellow community members put into sending patches, filing thoughtful
