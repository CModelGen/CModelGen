Hello! We have a bugfix release of Jekyll hot off the presses for you. Key
fixes to call out:

1. Only warn about auto-regeneration issues on Windows instead of disabling
2. Exclude very specific `vendor/` subdirectories instead of all of `vendor/`
3. Allow permalink templates to have plaintext underscores

..and lots more! Check out the [full history for more](/docs/history/#v3-3-1).

Happy Jekylling!
