Hey, folks! Bunch of bug fixes here. Notables:

* Only superdirectories of `_posts` will be categories.
* `:title` in permalink templates are now properly cased as before
* `.jekyll-metadata` being erroneously written when not using incremental build.
* Failure in liquid will now always fail the `jekyll` process.
* All hooks should now be properly registered & documented

And a bunch more changes which you can see over in the
[changelog](/docs/history).
