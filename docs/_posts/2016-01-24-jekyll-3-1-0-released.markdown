Happy weekend! To make your weekend all the better, we have just released
v3.1.0 of Jekyll.

There are _lots_ of great performance improvements, including a huge one
which is to use Liquid drops instead of hashes. Much of the slowness in
Jekyll is due to Jekyll making lots of objects it doesn't need to make.
By making these objects only as they're needed, we can speed up Jekyll
considerably!

Some other highlights:

* Fix: `permalink`s with non-HTML extensions will not be honored
* Fix: `jekyll clean` now accepts build flags like `--source`.
* Enhancement: `include` tags can now accept multiple liquid variables
* Feature: adds new `sample` liquid tag which gets random element from an array
* Fix: Jekyll will read in files with YAML front matter that has extraneous
spaces after the first line
* Enhancement: extract the `title` attribute from the filename for
collection items without a date
* Fix: gracefully handle empty configuration files

... and [a whole bunch more](/docs/history/#v3-1-0)!
